🦉 The Web Guru Demo Shopify Store

Showcasing Custom Mugs & Shopify Integration

Welcome to the Web Guru Demo Store, a fully functional Shopify integration demo designed to showcase how a custom website can seamlessly link to a Shopify backend for sales, checkout, and product management.

This demo uses The Web Guru Mug as its featured product — a clean, modern ceramic mug inspired by creators, coders, and night-owl innovators everywhere.

☕ About the Demo

This project demonstrates how small businesses can:

Host a custom landing page (built with HTML/CSS/JS)

Use a Shopify backend for e-commerce management

Connect custom "Buy on Shopify" buttons directly to secure checkouts

Integrate visuals, brand storytelling, and calls-to-action in a cohesive, mobile-friendly layout

The page design matches The Web Guru brand color scheme — deep blues, vibrant oranges, and clean whites — giving the demo a modern tech aesthetic perfect for developers, digital agencies, or content creators.

🛠️ Features

Custom HTML/CSS Frontend – Responsive, modern layout using semantic HTML5 and mobile-first design principles.

Dynamic Product Display – Dedicated <img> tag placeholder for product image (swap in your own).

Buy Button Integration – Large, styled “Buy from Shopify” button that redirects users straight to the Shopify checkout page.

Brand Consistency – Uses the same color palette and typography from The Web Guru brand.

Scalable Architecture – This structure can be reused for multiple product pages or client demos.

💡 How It Works

The frontend runs as a static or Django-served webpage (depending on deployment).

The “Buy from Shopify” button links to your specific product checkout URL on Shopify.

Shopify handles the backend — inventory, checkout, and payment processing.

You control the front-end experience and hosting.

This setup allows for full creative control over presentation without sacrificing the power and simplicity of Shopify’s backend.
